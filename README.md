# nk-os
Hobyist x64 kernel
Requirements: elf compatible x64 cross compiler without libgcc redzone support. For building the cross compiler use [this](https://github.com/ShadowDevZ/tc-bootstrapper) script.
limine bootloader `v5.x` is pulled and builded as dependency automatically. 

In the future the os is going to use custom linear framebuffer

Build is currently only supported on linux (the script requires /dev/null device and forward slashes as path separator, will make it compatible for windows in future)
!!!Bochs may not work properly if it was not compiled with graphics option!!!
- xorriso
- bash
- nm
- od
- nasm
- CC and LD (for dependencies)
- qemu or any emulator which is able to handle x64 iso and graphics mode
- objdump
- awk
- git
- gdb
- git
- python3 (pathlib, os, sys)
- VT100 compatible terminal that supports ANSI escape sequence for colored output

# Building
If running for the first time and you do not have separate `x86_64-elf`
cross compiler set check `configk/config.mk` and run `make first_setup`.
This will download the whole GNU toolhcian and set the symlink inside
the source directory for building.
If you already got working toolchain don't forget to set it inside
`config/config.mk`.

## Building from clean source tree
`make clean && make`. After build the ISO and ELF files alongside symbols
(if requested) are located inside the build directory.

## Downloading dependencies
If the Makefile doesn't automatically pull all build dependencies
(limine and flanterm) run `make bootstrap` command.

## Building with more debugging symbols
`make debug`. This creates external symbols inside file and disassembled source.

# Running
To run the target inside QEMU use `make run`.
Settings and parameters can be adjusted inside `config/config.mk`

## Debugging with QEMU/GDB
To debug the kernel run `make run_dbg` and navigate in second terminal
to the same source directory and run GDB. This will automatically hook
the target and set up the symbols. If you get a warning about safe execution you might have to add the init script as trusted inside
your `~/.gdbinit` config.

# Kernel runtime dependeincies
- X64 compatible emulator
